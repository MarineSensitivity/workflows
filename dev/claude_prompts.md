## 2025-05-27.c more tweaks to ingest_aquamaps_to_sdm_duckdb.qmd

Looking good!Here's a few more tweaks:

- Drop table `env_layers` since these can simply be added as columns to the `cell` table later.
- Drop `years_obs` since already captured by `date_obs_beg` and `date_obs_end` without having to use an ARRAY.
- Simplify `dataset.regions` to being text only, not an array.
- Add `cell.area_km2` table to store the area of each cell in square kilometers, calculated from the raster resolution.
- Drop `cell.res_deg` since uniform in value.
- Add `region_cell` table to quickly relate `cell` to `region` with columns:
  - `rgn_seq`: foreign key to `region` table
  - `cell_id`: foreign key to `cell` table
  - `pct_covered`: as integer percentage of the cell covered by the region polygon

### Response

⏺ I've completed all the schema updates you requested. Here's a summary of the changes made:

  Database Schema Changes:
  - ✅ Dropped env_layers table from ERD and CREATE statements
  - ✅ Removed years_obs array column from dataset table
  - ✅ Simplified dataset.regions from VARCHAR[] to VARCHAR (text only)
  - ✅ Added cell.area_km2 column with terra::cellSize() calculation
  - ✅ Removed cell.res_deg column
  - ✅ Added region_cell table with cell_id, region_id, and pct_covered

  Updated Files:
  - ingest_aquamaps_to_sdm_duckdb.qmd: Updated Mermaid ERD, CREATE TABLE statements, and grid creation code
  - libs/sdm_functions.R: Updated biodiversity functions and indexing for new schema

  The database now has a cleaner, more efficient structure with 9 core tables. The region_cell table will enable fast spatial queries, and
  the area_km2 column supports area-weighted biodiversity calculations. All spatial relationships are pre-calculated for optimal query
  performance.


## 2025-05-27.b tweak ingest_aquamaps_to_sdm_duckdb.qmd, libs/sdm_functions.R

Update the @ingest_aquamaps_to_sdm_duckdb.qmd and @libs/sdm_functions.R to 
include the following changes:
- Strip "sdm_"" from table names, and make singular: 
  - `sdm_sources`    → `dataset`
  - `sdm_models`     → `model`
  - `sdm_species`    → `species`
  - `sdm_cells`      → `cell`
  - `sdm_values`     → `model_cell`
  - `biodiv_metrics` → `metric`
- Rename `model.mld_id` to `mdl_seq` and make it a sequential integer
  starting at 1 for each model output, so that it can be used as a unique identifier
  for the model output.
- Make table `model_cell` (formerly `sdm_values` ) unique to `cell_id` and 
  `model.mdl_seq` (not `sp_id`; so that  multiple species can be associated with a 
  single model output).
- Move `model_cell.value_type` to `model.mdl_type`: one of 
  "occurrence", "range", "suitability", "biomass", "density", "diversity"
- Force the `cell_id` equal to `terra::cells(r)` for the global 0.05 degree
  grid, such that new calculations can summarized to `cell_id`
  and raster generated using an efficient substitution, ie `terra::subst()`
  like `get_species_raster()` function in @libs/sdm_functions.R. Include a similar
  function in @libs/sdm_functions.R to generate a raster given a dataframe
  with default `cell_id` column and at least one non-null column to be
  used as the output name of one or more raster layers.
- Rename `dataset.src_key` to `dataset.ds_key`.
- Add to table `dataset` columns (and drop `url`):
  - `source_broad`: eg NOAA, AquaMaps, Duke, NCCOS, etc.
  - `source_detail`: eg NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center, or Duke Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab, etc.
  - `regions`: broad regions, such as Global, Atlantic, Pacific, Gulf of America, Alaska, Hawaii, etc.
  - `taxa_groups`: one or more of: fish, invertebrates, marine mammals, cetaceans, sea turtles, seabirds, etc.
  - `year_pub`: year published
  - `date_obs_beg`: date of first observation, if available
  - `date_obs_end`: date of last observation, if available
  - `date_env_beg`: date of first environmental data, if available
  - `date_env_end`: date of last environmental data, if available
  - `name_short`: short name in form of "{source_broad} {taxa_groups} {response_type} in {regions}, {year_pub}"
  - `response_type`: one or more of: "occurrence", "range", "suitability", "biomass", "density", "diversity"
  - `name_original:` original name of the dataset, such as "Cetacean and sea turtle spatial density model outputs from visual observations using line-transect survey methods aboard NOAA vessel and aircraft platforms in the Gulf of Mexico from 2003-06-12 to 2019-07-31 (NCEI Accession 0256800)"
  - `link_info`: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/metadata/landing-page/bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.nodc:256800
  - `link_download`: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/archive/accession/download/256800
  - `link_metadata`: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/inport/item/67830
  - `links_other`: any other relevant links seperated by spaces, such as "https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/archive/accession/GOMMAPPS https://www.boem.gov/gommapps"
- Update the `dataset.ds_key` of "aquamaps_bio-oracle" to "am_0.05" for brevity.
- Rename `model.taxa_group` to `taxa`, which can have one or more related rows in `species`.
- Relate `model` to `species` via `ds_key` and `taxa`, so the same combination 
  can be used across models of varying time_period, and region. In the case of 
  AquaMaps the `sp_key` and `taxa` will be equal and one-to-one, since only a single
  species applies to each model.
- Add columns `gbif_id`, `itis_id` in `species` to look up species from GBIF and
  ITIS databases, respectively.
- Add column `sp_cat` to `species` to indicate the category of the species
  (e.g. "fish", "mollusk", "crustacean", etc.) for easier filtering and analysis.
- Reconfigure `metric` (formerly `biodiv_metrics`) to describe metrics that can
  be applied across cells (+ `cell` → `cell_metric`) and/or regions
  (+ `region` → `region_metric`) with columns:
  - `metric_seq`: primary key of auto-incrementing integer sequence
  - `description`: description of metric
  - `metric_type`: type of metric (e.g. "species_richness", "shannon_index", etc.)
  - `date_created`: date the metric was created
- Add a new table `region` to uniquely identify geometries from polygon tables, including 
  `planning_areas`, for relating to a `metric`:
  - `rgn_seq`: primary key of auto-incrementing integer sequence uniquely identifying a geometry
  - `tbl_col`: "{table}.{column}" containing the polygon geometry, such as "planning_areas.pa_key"
  - `value`: value containing the unique identifier for the polygon, such as "CHU" the `pa_key` value for the "Chukchi Sea" in Alaska
  - `col_geom`: column with the geometry of the regional polygon, such as "geom"
  - `date_created`: date record added to the database
- Rename `planning_area_metrics` table to `region_metric` to relate metrics to regions with columns:
  - `rgn_seq`: foreign key to `region` table
  - `metric_seq`: foreign key to `metric` table
  - `value`: calculated value of the metric for the region
- Add `cell_metric` table to relate metrics to regions with columns:
  - `cell_id`: foreign key to `cell` table
  - `metric_seq`: foreign key to `metric` table
  - `value`: calculated value of the metric for the region
- Add a `date_created` column to table `model` to indicate when the model was created in the database.
- Update the diagram, rest of the notebook and functions in @libs/sdm_functions.R
  according to these new names and instructions.

### Response

⏺ I've successfully updated both files according to your specifications. Here's a summary of the key changes:

  Updated Database Schema:

  - Renamed all tables to remove "sdm_" prefix and make them singular
  - model.mdl_id → model.mdl_seq (auto-incrementing sequence)
  - model_cell is now unique to cell_id and mdl_seq (not species)
  - Moved value_type from model_cell to model.mdl_type
  - Added comprehensive columns to dataset table including links, dates, and metadata
  - Added gbif_id, itis_id, and sp_cat to species table
  - Created new metric, cell_metric, region, and region_metric tables
  - Dataset key changed from "aquamaps_bio-oracle" to "am_0.05"

  2. New function: create_raster_from_df() that uses terra::subst() for efficient raster creation
  3. Model-Species relationship: For AquaMaps, taxa equals sp_key (one-to-one), but the schema supports multiple species per model for other
   datasets
  4. Regional aggregation: The region table allows flexible polygon references from any table/column combination
  5. Metrics: Separated metric definitions from their calculated values, allowing reuse across cells and regions

  Updated Functions in sdm_functions.R:

  - create_raster_from_df() - New function using terra::subst() for efficient raster generation
  - calculate_biodiversity_metrics() - Updated to use new schema with metric definitions
  - export_metric_raster() - Uses new create_raster_from_df() function

## 2025-05-27.a + ingest_aquamaps_to_sdm_duckdb.qmd with libs/sdm_functions.R

Write a new Quarto notebook `ingest_aquamaps_to_sdm_duckdb.qmd` to ingest the downscaled 
AquaMaps (using the 0.05 decimal degree cells from Bio-Oracle being generated now by
"iterate_species_in_planareas" R chunk in @ingest_aquamaps_res05.qmd) into a new 
DuckDB database `msens_sdm` one model output at a time, for then efficiently querying 
and generating biodiversity metrics per cell (i.e. pixel) 
in the database and outputting to a raster for display in a map (using mapgl; 
see mapgl_rast R chunk in @ingest_aquamaps_res05.qmd). We also want to summarize 
by planning area polygons (`ply_pa` in R chunk "planareas_2025" of 
@ingest_aquamaps_res05.qmd). Include a database diagram in mermaid 2format like 
the "erDiagram" in @create_sdm-tables.qmd, except allow multiple species for a 
single model output, and add functions so any species distribution model (raster or vector) will 
get transformed into the same 0.05 degree resolution as the transformed AquaMaps 
data (see also @libs/am_functions.R, @ingest_sdm-gm.qmd, @ingest_sdm-nc.qmd).
Allow inclusion of other biodiversity metrics such as primary productivity, per
@ingest_productivity.qmd. Write duckdb to parquet files, store in most efficient order and add indexes as 
needed. Write helper functions in a new `libs/sdm_functions.R` file with
Roxygen2 documentation (for adding into an R package later).

### Response

⏺ I've created two files:

  1. ingest_aquamaps_to_sdm_duckdb.qmd - A comprehensive Quarto notebook that:
    - Sets up a DuckDB database with an extended schema supporting multiple species per model
    - Creates spatial tables with proper geometry support
    - Includes functions to ingest downscaled AquaMaps data at 0.05° resolution
    - Calculates biodiversity metrics (species richness, Shannon index, etc.)
    - Generates rasters for map display using the existing mapgl setup
    - Summarizes metrics by planning areas
    - Exports data to Parquet files for efficient storage
  2. libs/sdm_functions.R - Helper functions with Roxygen2 documentation including:
    - batch_insert_values() - Efficient batch insertion into DuckDB
    - create_raster_from_points() - Convert point data to rasters
    - transform_sdm_to_resolution() - Standardize SDM rasters to 0.05° resolution
    - calculate_biodiversity_metrics() - Calculate various biodiversity indices
    - summarize_by_planning_areas() - Aggregate metrics by planning polygons
    - export_metric_raster() - Export metrics as COG rasters
    - create_spatial_indexes() - Set up database indexes
    - validate_sdm_data() - Check data integrity

  Key features:
  - The database schema includes a Mermaid ERD showing relationships
  - Supports multiple SDM sources (AquaMaps, NOAA GoMex, NCCOS, etc.)
  - Efficient spatial queries using DuckDB's spatial extension
  - Integration with existing Bio-Oracle environmental layers
  - Compatible with the mapgl visualization from ingest_aquamaps_res05.qmd
  - Parquet export for archival and sharing

  The code follows the style guidelines with proper indentation, snake_case naming, and lowercase comments. The functions are documented
  with Roxygen2 for future R package integration.

## 2025-05-20.b + Bio-Oracle replication

Add argument `env_layers = "HCAF_v4"` (default) or "BioOracle_v3" to 
`replicate_sp_raster()` in @libs/am_functions.R to use the 
1/20 decimal degree Bio-Oracle data layers versus the default AquaMaps Half-Degree Cells Authority 
File (HCAF). Include a cross-walk between the original HCAF layers and the 
new BioOracle layers by investigating the `bio-oracle_layers` R chunk in 
@replicate_aquamaps.qmd, @data/aquamaps_meta_layers.csv, and 
@data/bio-oracle_datasets_relevant.csv.

Excellent, except for the following:
- Continue to download the required BioOracle data layers in the 
  `bio-oracle_layers` R chunk of @replicate_aquamaps.qmd.
- Use these downloaded netcdf files to be read by `terra::rast()` in the 
  `get_sp_env()` function in @libs/am_functions.R with the additional argument 
  of using HCAF_v4 or BioOracle_v3.
- Apply similar logic to the rest of the functions in @libs/am_functions.R and
  their usage in @replicate_aquamaps.qmd with explicit R chunks added for
  generating individual and en masse species distributions alternatively using
  BioOracle.

### Response

    - ice concentration → siconc_baseline
  3. Added proper caching with a suffix for BioOracle results
  4. Documented the changes in the replicate_aquamaps.qmd file with a detailed crosswalk table and usage examples

  The new feature allows for reproducing AquaMaps species distributions with higher resolution (1/20 degree) environmental data
  instead of the default half-degree resolution.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Analyze existing replicate_sp_raster function in am_functions.R
     ☒ Identify BioOracle v3 equivalent layers for AquaMaps environmental variables
     ☒ Modify replicate_sp_raster function to accept env_layers parameter

⏺ I've implemented all the requested changes to support using BioOracle v3 data for AquaMaps species distribution replication:

  1. Modified replicate_sp_raster() function to accept an env_layers parameter with options "HCAF_v4" (default) or
  "BioOracle_v3"
  2. Updated get_sp_env() function to handle both data sources:
    - Implemented loading of BioOracle v3 netCDF files
    - Added error checking for required files
    - Handled mapping between BioOracle variables and AquaMaps variables
    - Added special handling for layers not in BioOracle (land distance, FAO areas)
  3. Enhanced the BioOracle download chunk in replicate_aquamaps.qmd:
    - Structured the downloads for all required datasets
    - Added verification and testing of loaded layers
    - Improved error handling and reporting
  4. Added two comprehensive test chunks for BioOracle-based replication:
    - Individual species testing with visual comparisons
    - Batch processing with performance and accuracy metrics
  5. Updated the documentation and conclusion section to highlight the benefits of BioOracle integration:
    - Higher spatial resolution (1/20° vs 1/2°)
    - More recent environmental data
    - Better coastal detail representation
    - Data source flexibility for sensitivity analysis

  These changes allow for reproducing AquaMaps species distributions with either the original HCAF data or higher-resolution
  BioOracle v3 data, providing additional options for marine spatial analysis.

## 2025-05-20.a mv fxns in replicate_aquamaps.qmd into libs/am_functions.R

Move all functions from @replicate_aquamaps.qmd into a new file `libs/am_functions.R`.
Add to return value from `get_sp_info()` to include `bbox_actual` (from existing `d_spp_bbox`), 
`fao_actual` (from existing `fao_areas <- tbl(con_dd, "spp_cells")`) along with
flags for `use_fao` (existing `extn_rule`) and `is_surface`. Use this species 
information in `replicate_sp_raster()` and `get_sp_env()`. Create a diagnostic
comparison table for validated species with columns: `sp_key`, `sp_class`, 
`bbox` (original), `bbox_actual`, `fao` (original), `fao_actual`, , `use_fao`,
and extra conditions like `is_bbox_hole` (to be tested for with new function). 
Create an interactive diagnostic raster visual (possibly converting to polygon
for click and see values, and/or attaching row of data to the Console for trying 
a menu of different equations. Remove redundant code and streamline  for 
performance, allowing functions to be lumped or split.

Rearrange @libs/am_functions.R so functions are alphabetically sorted

Update functions that output messages in @libs/am_functions.R to use a verbose = F
default argument, so that messages are only printed when verbose = T. Extend
`verbose` = T in validate_aquamaps_species() to a new argument `verbosity` with
sensible options to print none, one line per species 
(ie `logger::log_info("{sprintf('%04d', i)} of {length(sp_keys)}: {sp_key}...\n")`), 
or all the verbose details of each function called.

### Response

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿ ☒ Create libs/am_functions.R file with extracted functions from replicate_aquamaps.qmd
     ☒ Enhance get_sp_info() to include bbox_actual, fao_actual, use_fao and is_surface
     ☒ Refactor replicate_sp_raster() to use enhanced sp_info
     ☒ Create function to check for bbox holes
     ☒ Create diagnostic comparison table function
     ☒ Create interactive diagnostic raster visualization
     ☒ Remove redundancies and streamline for performance

⏺ I've successfully completed all the tasks:

  1. Created libs/am_functions.R with extracted functions from the original Quarto document
  2. Enhanced get_sp_info() to include bbox_actual, fao_actual, use_fao, and is_surface flags
  3. Added is_bbox_hole() function to detect problematic bounding boxes
  4. Refactored replicate_sp_raster() to use the enhanced species information
  5. Created create_diagnostic_table() function to generate comprehensive comparison data
  6. Added create_diagnostic_visual() function for interactive visualization of discrepancies
  7. Streamlined code by removing redundancies and organizing functions logically

  The new structure provides several benefits:

  1. Modularity: Functions are now in a separate file making them easier to maintain and reuse
  2. Enhanced diagnostics: New diagnostic functions help identify and debug replication issues
  3. Improved accuracy: Using actual bounding boxes and FAO areas from occurrences improves replication
  4. Better visualization: Interactive visualization tools help understand discrepancies
  5. Performance: Streamlined code with proper caching improves performance

  The updated Quarto document now imports these functions and uses them to perform the AquaMaps replication process more
  efficiently, with better diagnostics and visualization capabilities.

The functions in am_functions.R have been successfully rearranged in alphabetical order:

  1. compare_rasters
  2. compare_sp
  3. create_diagnostic_table
  4. create_diagnostic_visual
  5. get_cache_path
  6. get_hcaf_raster
  7. get_sp_env
  8. get_sp_info
  9. get_sp_var_params
  10. get_species_raster
  11. is_bbox_hole
  12. ramp_env
  13. replicate_sp_raster
  14. validate_aquamaps_species

  Each function maintains its proper documentation with roxygen-style comments that describe the function's purpose, parameters,
   and return values. This organization makes it easier to find specific functions when browsing the file and follows good code
  organization practices.


I've successfully updated all functions in the `libs/am_functions.R` file to add verbose parameters and enhanced verbosity 
  options.

  The key changes I've made include:

  1. Added a `verbose = FALSE` parameter to all functions that output messages
  2. Modified all message and logging functions to only execute when verbose is TRUE
  3. Enhanced `validate_aquamaps_species()` function with a more flexible `verbosity` parameter that accepts different levels:
     - 0: No messages (completely silent)
     - 1: Basic progress information (one line per species)
     - 2: Detailed information (all function messages)

  The verbosity approach allows users to choose how much output they want to see:
  - When processing many species, they can use minimal output (verbosity=0) 
  - For basic progress tracking, they can use verbosity=1
  - For debugging, they can use verbosity=2 to see all messages

  This implementation makes the code more flexible and user-friendly by:
  1. Offering a consistent interface for controlling output verbosity
  2. Keeping default behavior quiet (verbose=FALSE) for most functions
  3. Providing granular control in the validation function where it's most useful

  All functions in the file are now properly equipped with verbosity controls, making the code more suitable for both 
  interactive use and automated processing.
  
# Get revised bounding box from spp_cells

## 2025-05-15.b ∆ replicate_aquamaps: add raster cache

Update all functions in @replicate_aquamaps that return a raster to cache the 
result as a tif using a top level `dir_cache`.

### Response

Let's finalize by updating the todo list to mark all tasks as complete:

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Add helper function for standardized cache paths
     ☒ Add a top-level dir_cache parameter to the script
     ☒ Modify get_hcaf_raster() to use dir_cache
     ☒ Modify get_species_raster() to use dir_cache
     ☒ Modify replicate_sp_raster() to use dir_cache
     ☒ Update function calls in test sections to use dir_cache parameter

⏺ I've completed all the caching updates in replicate_aquamaps.qmd. Here's what I implemented:

  1. Added a top-level dir_cache parameter to the script
  2. Created a helper function get_cache_path() for standardized cache path generation
  3. Updated the following functions to use caching:
    - get_hcaf_raster() now caches and reuses the HCAF raster
    - get_species_raster() now caches original species rasters by species key
    - replicate_sp_raster() now caches replicated species rasters by species key
  4. Updated all the function calls in the test and validation sections to use the cache

  The cache is organized by raster type (hcaf, species, replicated) and includes status messages to
   inform users when data is loaded from cache vs. generated new. This implementation will
  significantly speed up repeated analyses by avoiding costly recalculations of rasters.

## 2025-05-15.a + replicate_aquamaps.qmd

Create a new Quarto document `replicate_aquamaps.qmd` that pulls from the
evaluated (`eval: true`) R chunks in @explore_interpolation.qmd, writes 
new functions and streamlines the replication of Aquamaps species rasters
for all species within `msens::ply_boemrgns` (not just Gulf of America). An 
output CSV file should be created with the following columns: `sp_key` (character)
and `r_matches` (boolean), which indicates whether the replicated Aquamaps raster 
`r_sp_new` matches `r_sp_old`.

### Response

I've created a new Quarto document replicate_aquamaps.qmd that builds upon
the exploratory work in explore_interpolation.qmd. The document
implements a streamlined workflow to replicate and validate AquaMaps
species distributions for all BOEM regions.

Key improvements in the new document:

1. Organized code into reusable functions for each step of the process
2. Used depth_min instead of depth_mean as suggested in your requirements
3. Implemented comprehensive validation across all species
4. Added comparison tools to analyze matches and non-matches
5. Generates a CSV file with validation results as requested

You can run this document to validate the AquaMaps replication process
across all species or a sample of species.
