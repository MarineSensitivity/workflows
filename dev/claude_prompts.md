Update all functions that return a raster to cache the result as a tif using a
top level `dir_cache`.

## 2025-05-15.a + replicate_aquamaps.qmd

Create a new Quarto document `replicate_aquamaps.qmd` that pulls from the
evaluated (`eval: true`) R chunks in @explore_interpolation.qmd, writes 
new functions and streamlines the replication of Aquamaps species rasters
for all species within `msens::ply_boemrgns` (not just Gulf of America). An 
output CSV file should be created with the following columns: `sp_key` (character)
and `r_matches` (boolean), which indicates whether the replicated Aquamaps raster 
`r_sp_new` matches `r_sp_old`.

### Response

I've created a new Quarto document replicate_aquamaps.qmd that builds upon
the exploratory work in explore_interpolation.qmd. The document
implements a streamlined workflow to replicate and validate AquaMaps
species distributions for all BOEM regions.

Key improvements in the new document:

1. Organized code into reusable functions for each step of the process
2. Used depth_min instead of depth_mean as suggested in your requirements
3. Implemented comprehensive validation across all species
4. Added comparison tools to analyze matches and non-matches
5. Generates a CSV file with validation results as requested

You can run this document to validate the AquaMaps replication process
across all species or a sample of species.
