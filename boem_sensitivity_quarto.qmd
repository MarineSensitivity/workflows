# BOEM Marine Environmental Sensitivity Analysis

## Updated Methodology for 2025 Planning Areas

### Summary of Methodology

BOEM is required under Section 18(a)(2)(G) of the OCS Lands Act to consider the relative environmental sensitivity and marine productivity of the OCS when making decisions regarding the schedule of lease sales for the National OCS Program. Building upon previous assessments, this updated methodology leverages the best available species distribution models and high-resolution environmental data to provide enhanced spatial resolution and taxonomic coverage for environmental sensitivity analysis.

The current approach combines vulnerability and resilience of marine ecosystems to potential impacts from offshore energy development activities within the context of existing environmental conditions and climate change. This analysis incorporates multiple authoritative data sources downscaled to 0.05° resolution rasters before aggregating to BOEM Planning Areas by taxonomic category.

### Processing Methodology

#### Spatial Standardization

All data sources are processed to a common 0.05° decimal degree grid (~5.5 km resolution) using:

1. **Bilinear interpolation** for continuous variables (suitability, density, productivity)
2. **Nearest neighbor** for categorical variables (habitat types, presence/absence)
3. **Area-weighted aggregation** for polygon-to-raster conversion
4. **Temporal averaging** for multi-temporal datasets

#### Taxonomic Categorization

Species are classified into standardized taxonomic categories:

- **Crustaceans**: Decapods, copepods, krill, and other arthropods
- **Fish**: All ray-finned and cartilaginous fish species
- **Marine Mammals**: Cetaceans, pinnipeds, sirenians, and sea otters
- **Mollusks**: Gastropods, bivalves, cephalopods
- **Sea Turtles**: All marine turtle species
- **Seabirds**: Marine and coastal bird species
- **Other Taxa**: Cnidarians, echinoderms, and remaining groups

#### Extinction Risk Integration

Species are weighted by IUCN Red List conservation status:

- **Critically Endangered (CR)**: 1.0
- **Endangered (EN)**: 0.8
- **Vulnerable (VU)**: 0.6
- **Near Threatened (NT)**: 0.4
- **Least Concern (LC)**: 0.2

#### Ecoregional Scaling

To enable comparative analysis across biogeographically distinct regions, scores are scaled using ecoregional min-max normalization:

$$Score_{scaled} = \frac{Score_{raw} - Min_{ecoregion}}{Max_{ecoregion} - Min_{ecoregion}} \times 100$$

This approach accounts for natural differences in species richness and productivity between Arctic, temperate, and tropical ecosystems.

### BOEM Ecoregions (Updated 2025)

The analysis uses nine BOEM ecoregions that align with Large Marine Ecosystem boundaries:

1. **Chukchi and Beaufort Seas** - Arctic marine ecosystem
2. **Eastern Bering Sea** - Subarctic shelf ecosystem  
3. **Gulf of Alaska** - Transitional subarctic ecosystem
4. **Washington/Oregon** - Upwelling-dominated temperate ecosystem
5. **California Current** - Eastern boundary current ecosystem
6. **Western and Central Gulf of America** - Subtropical shelf ecosystem
7. **Eastern Gulf of America** - Carbonate platform ecosystem
8. **Southeast U.S. Continental Shelf** - Western Atlantic warm temperate
9. **Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf** - Western Atlantic cold temperate

*Note: Gulf of Mexico has been renamed to Gulf of America in 2025 planning documents.*

### Planning Area Aggregation

Within each planning area, taxonomic and productivity scores are calculated as:

1. **Cell-level scoring**: Combine species suitability with extinction risk weights
2. **Taxonomic aggregation**: Sum weighted scores within each taxonomic category
3. **Spatial aggregation**: Area-weighted mean across planning area cells
4. **Final scoring**: Equal-weighted average of taxonomic and productivity components

### Visualization: Flower Plot

Results are visualized using a flower plot format where:

- **Petal length**: Represents the scaled sensitivity score (0-100)
- **Petal width**: Represents relative importance/weight
- **Petal color**: Distinguishes taxonomic categories and primary productivity
- **Center score**: Overall sensitivity index for the planning area

```r
# Example flower plot structure
components <- c("Crustaceans", "Fish", "Marine Mammals", 
               "Mollusks", "Sea Turtles", "Seabirds", 
               "Other Taxa", "Primary Productivity")
scores <- c(45, 67, 82, 34, 91, 56, 28, 73)
weights <- rep(1, 8)  # Equal weighting

plot_flower(
  categories = components,
  heights = scores,
  widths = weights,
  title = "Alaska Planning Area Sensitivity"
)
```

### Climate Change Integration

The ecosystem change vulnerability index incorporates:

- **Temperature change**: Regional warming trends
- **Sea ice dynamics**: Arctic and subarctic changes  
- **Ocean acidification**: pH and aragonite saturation
- **Sea level rise**: Coastal habitat impacts
- **Storm intensity**: Extreme weather patterns
- **Species composition**: Range shifts and invasions
- **Permafrost thaw**: Arctic-specific impacts

Scores range from 0-4 and are added to base sensitivity scores.

### Model Validation and Uncertainty

The updated methodology includes:

- **Cross-validation** with independent survey data
- **Uncertainty propagation** from input data sources
- **Sensitivity analysis** to key parameter assumptions
- **Expert review** of taxonomic classifications and weights
- **Temporal validation** using historical data splits

### Applications and Limitations

**Applications:**

- Comparative ranking of planning areas for lease sale scheduling
- Environmental impact assessment support
- Marine spatial planning and conflict identification
- Research prioritization and monitoring design

**Limitations:**

- Model resolution limits fine-scale assessment
- Data gaps for some taxonomic groups and regions
- Static analysis doesn't capture dynamic oceanographic processes
- Equal weighting may not reflect all stakeholder values

### Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:

- **Dynamic modeling**: Seasonal and interannual variability
- **Ecosystem services**: Quantification of marine ecosystem benefits
- **Cumulative impacts**: Integration with existing stressors
- **Stakeholder weighting**: Alternative value frameworks
- **Real-time updates**: Integration with monitoring networks
